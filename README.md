# STM32 Bare Metal Project üöÄ

## Overview üìñ

This project demonstrates bare metal programming on the STM32F070RB microcontroller, implementing a temperature monitoring and LED control system. The application showcases direct hardware manipulation through register-level programming, without relying on HAL or other abstraction layers.

The system allows users to interact via UART serial communication, where they can toggle temperature monitoring on/off and control the LED brightness level. This project serves as an educational platform to understand low-level peripheral configuration and bare metal development for STM32 microcontrollers.

## Project Goals üéØ

- Demonstrate bare metal programming techniques on STM32 microcontrollers
- Implement direct register access for peripheral configuration and control
- Create interactive user interfaces through UART communication
- Showcase real-time temperature monitoring using the internal temperature sensor
- Implement PWM-based LED brightness control with user input

## Features ‚ú®

- **Temperature Monitoring**: Reads the internal temperature sensor and displays values in Celsius
- **LED Brightness Control**: Adjusts onboard LED brightness using PWM with 100 levels (0-99%)
- **Interactive UART Interface**: Accepts and processes user commands over serial communication
- **Precise Timing Control**: Implements millisecond-accurate delays using SysTick timer
- **Command System**:
  - `T` - Toggle temperature reading ON/OFF
  - `L<0-99>` - Set LED brightness level (0 = OFF, 99 = maximum brightness)
